C++ naming analyzer for style used in my workplace. Just started, so don't expect this to be useful.

Implemented by using python bindings to libclang. So far tested only on Linux.

** Running the analyzer

Requires that python bindings to libclang are in PYTHONPATH. E.g.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ export PYTHONPATH=../vendor/llvm/tools/clang/bindings/python/
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Testing

Unit tests use pytest, so just:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ py.test
#+END_EXAMPLE

Higher level tests are implemented using behave. They require that you have defined path to the LLVM dynamic library location as LLVM_PATH environment variable. After that you can run behave.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ export LLVM_PATH=/home/byon/src/vendor/llvm/build/Release/lib
$ behave
#+END_EXAMPLE
